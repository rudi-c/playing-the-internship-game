## Side projects

If you've been surfing around the Internet looking for tech internship-related tips, you've probably come across this phrase: !SIDE PROJECTS!

### What they're for

Doing a side project for the first time can be intimidating. In school, you've always been given tasks with some guideline and a goal. Now you're tasked to do something with no guidelines or and nobody even tells you what the goal is. What?

This is why I want to first talk about why people care about side projects, why it matters, but also what doesn't matter. With !SIDE PROJECTS! being thrown around so much, it can be easy to believe that you have to publish some amazing app to get hired. This is not the case, which is why...

**PLEASE PLEASE please don't spend all your time on coding projects unless that's just how you like to spend your time** you don't _have_ to do side projects to be successful even though it often is talked about as if you do



- If you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills
- These don't have to be big or take too long to do! It's totally okay to make something assignment sized that takes less than a week of work, or a few hours on a weekend.
- If you don't feel like you have the skills to make something yet, or don't have any ideas, you can take a short online course that involves a project!
- Projects are important when you don't have work experience yet, but they're not as essential once you have work experience on your resume

You don’t have to build something super fancy complicated. You can create something through a course (like this [Udacity web development course](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253)) or make a game like hangman or build a calculator or whatever else you can think of. You’ll be surprised how complicated “simple projects” can be and how much you can learn. That’s what employers want to see.
